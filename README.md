Email Click Prediction using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether an email will be clicked based on various features such as email length, number of call-to-actions (CTAs), subject line length, and time of day. The classification is performed using machine learning models trained on historical email marketing data.

ðŸ“Š Data Analysis & Preprocessing

Two Jupyter notebooks were used for data analysis and machine learning model development:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing:

Performed data cleaning and handled missing values.

Conducted feature engineering (e.g., extracting day of the week, categorizing times of day).

Applied outlier handling for numerical features.

Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Trained multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Selected the best model for deployment.

ðŸš€ Web Application

A Flask-based web application is developed to classify new email data.

How it Works:

The user sends email feature data via a POST request.

The app processes the data (applies encoding, scaling, and outlier handling).

The trained model predicts whether the email will be clicked or not.

The result is displayed in the UI.
